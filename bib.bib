  Abstract                 = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine householdsâ behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper evaluates a series of programs run by a company called OPOWER to send Home Energy Report letters to residential utility customers comparing their electricity use to that of their neighbors. Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of "injunctive norms" played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage.},

  Abstract                 = {In the electricity sector, energy conservation through technological and behavioral change is estimated to have a savings potential of 123 million metric tons of carbon per year, which represents 20% of US household direct emissions in the United States. In this article, we investigate the effectiveness of nonprice information strategies to motivate conservation behavior. We introduce environment and health-based messaging as a behavioral strategy to reduce energy use in the home and promote energy conservation. In a randomized controlled trial with real-time appliance-level energy metering, we find that environment and health-based information strategies, which communicate the environmental and public health externalities of electricity production, such as pounds of pollutants, childhood asthma, and cancer, outperform monetary savings information to drive behavioral change in the home. Environment and health-based information treatments motivated 8% energy savings versus control and were particularly effective on families with children, who achieved up to 19% energy savings. Our results are based on a panel of 3.4 million hourly appliance-level kilowatt–hour observations for 118 residences over 8 mo. We discuss the relative impacts of both cost-savings information and environmental health messaging strategies with residential consumers.},

pose significant challenges for M&S engineers, project managers, and sponsoring 
organizations. This paper presents a M&S life cycle to alleviate the challenges. The M&S life 
cycle describes a framework for organization of the processes, work products, quality 
assurance activities, and project management activities required to develop, use, maintain, 
and reuse a M&S application from birth to retirement. It provides guidance to a M&S 
developer (engineer), manager, organization, and community of interest. The M&S life cycle 
specifies the work products to be created by executing the corresponding processes, 
together with the integrated verification, validation, and quality assurance activities. The 
M&S life cycle is critically needed to modularize and structure a M&S application 
development, and to provide valuable guidance for conducting a M&S project 
successfully.},

  Abstract                 = { A procedure is given for using Hotelling's two-sample T2 test to test the validity with respect to the mean behavior of a multivariate response simulation model that represents an observable system. A tradeoff analysis can be made to help the modeler decide on a data collection method and budget, the number of observations to collect, and suitable model builder's and user's risk levels for testing the validity under a given set of experimental conditions. A model of an M/M/1 queuing system with two performance measures serves as an example for the validation procedure. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the effect of transparent energy monitoring systems on the purchasing, production and energy use behaviour of consumers and producers. Relevant literature is explored on the linkages between feedback, risk and responsibility, knowledge, economic drivers, and sustainable energy consumption. Drawing on international as well as UK-specific experiences, the paper focuses on the prospects for current and future energy monitoring systems to âre-materialiseâ energy use in economic and environmental terms that are more meaningful, and thus more behaviourally significant, to a substantially wider range of energy users than today's. Appliance labelling, smart metering and carbon footprint analyses are explored as case studies. },

  Abstract                 = {Metamodeling and model transformations are the key concepts in Model Driven Development (MDD) approaches as they provide a mechanism for automated development of well structured and maintainable systems. However, neither defining a metamodel nor developing a model transformation is an easy task. In this paper, we provide an overview of metamodeling and model transformations in MDD and discuss about the use of a MDD approach in Modeling and Simulation (M&S). In order to support the development of successful model transformations, we define the criteria for the evaluation of model transformations.},

  Abstract                 = {Consumer adoption of renewable energies is an important step towards less carbon-intensive and more sustainable energy systems. But despite growing ecological awareness and articulated preferences for green products, renewable energies face slow rates of diffusion in consumer markets. This has been hard to explain given consumers’ favorability to the concept of products that lower one’s impact on the natural environment. This study uses data from 254 homeowners in Ireland to investigate the psychological process of adopting a renewable energy system – solar energy panels. Applying Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), this research examines a proposed model in which reasons both for and against adopting solar panels mediate the relationship between consumers’ attitudes, values and adoption intentions. Results suggest the model is generally supported with both reasons for adoption and reasons against adoption having countervailing influences in the psychological processing of adoption intentions. These findings suggest that researchers and marketers should include mediating constructs, such as (i) reasons for adoption, (ii) reasons against adoption, and (iii) attitudes toward a technology when attempting to explain how consumers think about the adoption of renewable energy systems.},

This paper sets out some considerations from learning theory that offer a useful way of looking at domestic energy awareness and at actions to improve energy efficiency and conserve energy. Findings from a survey of residents of an English village that had won an â??energy-conscious villageâ?? competition are used to illustrate how individual and social learning can occur over a period of time, and how a â??top downâ?? initiative may relate to other more informal sources of motivation and information. A model of learning about domestic energy use that incorporates awareness, action and feedback is proposed, and the implications for policy and further research are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Strategies that provide information about the environmental impact of activities are increasingly seen as effective to encourage conservation behavior. This article offers the most comprehensive meta-analysis of information based energy conservation experiments conducted to date. Based on evidence from 156 published field trials and 525,479 study subjects from 1975 to 2012, we quantify the energy savings from information based strategies. On average, individuals in the experiments reduced their electricity consumption by 7.4%. Our results also show that strategies providing individualized audits and consulting are comparatively more effective for conservation behavior than strategies that provide historical, peer comparison energy feedback. Interestingly, we find that pecuniary feedback and incentives lead to a relative increase in energy usage rather than induce conservation. We also find that the conservation effect diminishes with the rigor of the study, indicating potential methodological issues in the current literature. },

  Abstract                 = {Unsustainable energy consumption is a systemic problem facing societies. While technological innovations are necessary to address this problem, they are not sufficient; they need to be integrated with social and behavioral changes in order to be most effective. Our approach is based on understanding and using participatory design as a paradigm for software design as well as the foundation for socio-technical environments that enable and support a cultural shift from passive consumers of energy to active decisions makers. Our research is grounded in two theoretical frameworks, meta-design and cultures of participation. We are developing EMPIRE, a socio-technical environment supporting rich ecologies of participation that enable people to become active designers of their energy consumption. EMPIRE engages people to participate in the design of their own energy environment and supports individuals and communities in understanding and making more sustainable choices regarding energy.},

  Abstract                 = {Even though we have moved beyond the Industrial Age and into the Information Age, manufacturing remains an important part of the global economy. There is a need for the pervasive use of modeling and simulation for decision support in current and future manufacturing systems, and several challenges need to be addressed by the simulation community to realize this vision. First, an order of magnitude reduction in problem-solving cycles is needed. The second grand challenge is the development of real-time, simulation-based problem-solving capability. The third grand challenge is the need for true plug-and-play interoperability of simulations and supporting software. Finally, there is the biggest challenge facing modeling and simulation analysts today: that of convincing management to sponsor modeling and simulation projects instead of, or in addition to, more commonly used manufacturing system design and improvement methods such as lean manufacturing and six sigma.},

  Abstract                 = {Much of the performance of a logistic system is determined by the quality of its design. A rich body of knowledge has been developed during the last decades that supports the product as well as the process of designing. Design methods for systems have initially defined the product by providing a framework to construct models to analyze the constructed artifact. This approach, which would later be coined the hard systems approach, would turn out to contain flaws in assumptions concerning of the existence of an (quasi-) optimal solution and by neglecting humans involved in the process. However, the techniques developed to support the approach, most notably simulation, have matured and are now commonly used to analyze designs. A major shift in approach took place to redeem for the perceived failures in systems design processes. This resulted in a tendency to focus on the diverging views of actors involved in the process, which was termed as the soft systems approaches. To profit from both sides, multimethodological approaches have been presented, assuming that a combination is feasible to take the best of both worlds. Participative simulation sessions have the potential to support the design processes: (1) in a multi-actor environment with diverging stakes, and (2) without ignoring the fact that human decision making relies on implicit knowledge that is insufficient and unreliable to evaluate decisions, thus requiring simulation for support. In this chapter, we present the rationale for requiring a multimethodological approach and discuss which aspects should be covered based on existing research literature.},

  Abstract                 = {Modeling and simulation in design processes is traditionally used during the analysis of the future system. However, simulation-based design allows the use of modeling and simulation throughout the synthesis phase which offers greater flexibility to quickly compare alternative designs. In case of container terminals, these alternatives are based on different aspects such as layouts, terminal operating systems, and equipments. Container terminals are characterized by a large number of entity types with multiple instances, interacting in various non-trivial ways. A component-based approach makes the construction of a suitable model easier: the designer can focus on the relevant constructs instead of lower level details. However, much effort is needed to achieve compatibility and modularity between the components. DEVS provides the higher level constructs to conceptualize a complex system independently from the underlying implementation. We present a DEVS component library for container terminal design wherein much attention has been put into the conceptual distinction between control and mechanics. This results in a library that can actively support the design process of containers terminals.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the aims, methodology and results of an empirical research project. The aim was to gather new insight about how collaborative decision-making processes in the conceptual engineering design phase of the product development process takes place. The insight contributes to bridging the gap between the theoretical development of new decision-making methods in academia and the needs of practitioners. The researchers observed, recorded and transcribed three workshops involving groups that were engaged in the collaborative decision-making processes. Through analysing the transcripts, a set of decision-making related activities was identified. Each activity's time consumption was quantified, and a number of decision-making process models at different levels of detail were developed. During this analysis, various observations on particular process characteristics were made. It was observed that generating formal structures and documentation was beneficial to the decision-making process. This was particularly true with respect to developing problem understanding and consistency. The outcomes should be valuable for the design and development of improved decision-support systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Flexibility is emerging as an increasingly sought after property in electricity systems. After decades of fossil fuel based power generation, system operators
are facing difficult times, if conventional plants are increasingly displaced by less
controllable renewable sources of electricity.
Alongside calls for enhanced networks and storage, the demand side is expected to become flexible for the benefit of the system. The value of the technical potential is said to be as high as £5 billion per year.
This paper systematically reviews flexibility as a dynamic property on supply and demand side. In doing so it attempts to shift the perspective from ‘what flexibility is for’ to ‘where flexibility comes from’.
Eight mechanisms of demand side flexibility are identified and illustrated with a range of examples highlighting the origins and costs associated with providing
them. Parallels and differences with supply side flexibility are exposed and discussed.
This approach leads to the conclusion that even seemingly automated forms of
demand response rely to a large degree on flexibility of energy users. Common currencies of flexibility include material, skill, time and space. To better under-
stand the potential of demand side flexibility, this paper calls for more dynamic and larger scale studies, which not only capture observable load shifts, but also explore the underlying dynamics and broad range of factors which can inhibit
flexibility.},

  Abstract                 = {Price signals have been suggested to bring about greater demand side flexibility and thus support the integration of variable sources of energy, such as wind. A conflict exists between keeping these signals simple for consumers, while making responses appropriate for increasingly complex supply-demand balancing dynamics in future. This study reviews some of the demand responses observed in time-of-use (ToU) tariff trials and assesses their effectiveness in scenarios with higher levels of wind. The authors simulate wholesale real-time prices for high-wind scenarios as a benchmark tariff. Simple tariff structures are compared against real-time prices for the extent to which they can `nudge' demand in the `right direction'. They present results which suggest that even in high-wind scenarios, simple ToU tariffs could have a beneficial effect on overall system costs. The load shifting and reduction behaviour observed under ToU trials could lower energy costs by between 4 and 6\% without the need for complex price signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical estimates of long run effects on residential electricity demand from changes in the electricity price are usually estimated by cross-sectional variation in the current stock of electric household appliances across households at a certain point in time. Here, we use a discrete–continuous approach modeling the long run effects by investments in new appliances. We apply the annual Norwegian Survey of Consumer Expenditure for the period 1975 to 1994 to estimate the short and long run own price elasticities in the two approaches. We find the estimated long run elasticity only slightly more price elastic than the short run. We also find that the long run elasticity does not differ significantly between the two approaches. The reason for both results is that, since there is no alternative source of energy for these appliances, there are no substitution effects.},

After examining relevant bodies of literature on the effects of energy feedback on consumption behaviour, and on the complex role of energy and appliances within household moral economies, the paper draws on qualitative evidence from interviews with 15 \{UK\} householders trialling smart energy monitors of differing levels of sophistication. It focuses specifically on householder motivations for acquiring the monitors, how the monitors have been used, how feedback has changed consumption behaviour, and the limitations to further behavioural change the householders experienced. The paper concludes by identifying significant implications for future research and policy in this area. },

  Abstract                 = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a state-of-the-art survey of statistical analyses for simulation output data of a single simulated system. The various statistical problems associated with output data analyses such as start-up bias and determination of estimator accuracy are described in detail. We then discuss the best available techniques for addressing these problems, as well as topics for future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of how developments in simulation languages, computer graphics, and computer execution speed may affect the future of output analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {Eight sixth-grade students received individualized instruction on addition and subtraction of fractions in a one-to-one setting for six weeks. Instruction was designed to build on the student's informal knowledge of fractions. All students possessed a rich store of informal knowledge of fractions that was based on partitioning units and treating the parts as whole numbers. Students' informal knowledge was initially disconnected from their knowledge of fraction symbols and procedures. Students related fraction symbols and procedures to their informal knowledge in ways that were meaningful to them; however, knowledge of rote procedures frequently interfered with students' attempts to build on their informal knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {La 4e de couverture indique : "What is the role of things in political participation ? This inventive book offers a fresh perspective on everyday forms of engagement, one that foregrounds the role of objects, technology and settings in relation to public involvement. It makes a distinctive contribution to debates about the material dimension of democracy, proposing that we must attend more closery to the settings in which things acquire the power to engage. It develops this argument through a series of case studies of contemporary devices of participation, such as smart electricity meters, demonstrational eco-homes and sustainable living gadgets. This book then offers a novel approach to the analysis of specifically material forms of paticipation. "Material participation" explores the next steps that might be taken in social studies of engagement, technology and the environment, focusing our critical and creative attention squarely on the materials and devices of the public."},

Usefulness of simulation modeling techniques was investigated and an attempt was made to correlate the simulation approach with a corresponding health care application group from the suggested classification.},

  Abstract                 = {Modeling and simulation are quickly becoming the primary enablers for complex system design. They allow the representation of intricate knowledge at various levels of abstraction and allow automated analysis as well as synthesis. The heterogeneity of the design process, as much as of the system itself, however, requires a manifold of formalisms tailored to the specific task at hand. Efficient design approaches aim to combine different models of a system under study and maximally use the knowledge captured in them. Computer Automated Multi-Paradigm Modeling (CAMPaM) is the emerging field that addresses the issues involved and formulates a domain-independent framework along three dimensions: (1) multiple levels of abstraction, (2) multiformalism modeling, and (3) meta-modeling. This article presents an overview of the CAMPaM field and shows how transformations assume a central place. These transformation are, in turn, explicitly modeled themselves by graph grammars.},

  Abstract                 = {
 The present research investigated the persuasive impact and detectability of normative social influence. The first study surveyed 810 Californians about energy conservation and found that descriptive normative beliefs were more predictive of behavior than were other relevant beliefs, even though respondents rated such norms as least important in their conservation decisions. Study 2, a field experiment, showed that normative social influence produced the greatest change in behavior compared to information highlighting other reasons to conserve, even though respondents rated the normative information as least motivating. Results show that normative messages can be a powerful lever of persuasion but that their influence is underdetected.

  Abstract                 = {It is commonly assumed that attitudes and behaviours need to be modified to secure a sustainable energy future. This paper examines insights from the social sciences in this extensive field. Alongside instruments such as regulation and economic measures, government campaigns have sought to ‘educate’ the public. However, such ‘information deficit’ models have been criticised on theoretical and pragmatic grounds. In the area of energy consumption, there is a need to take account of the physical, social, cultural and institutional contexts that shape and constrain people's choices, and for a richer understanding of opposition to energy facility siting, which has often been (inadequately) characterised as ‘NIMBYism’. Recent work also points to the need for more deliberation and better communication between decision-makers, technical experts, other stakeholders and the public. Predicting future developments in the field is challenging but attention is likely to focus on aspects of policy learning, a more critical examination of the ‘deliberative turn’, and the need for a systemic approach to complex socio-economic and socio-technical systems. The consistency of government objectives across all policy spheres is likely to provide an important avenue for future research.},

While there is plenty of experience in optimizing energy generation and distribution, it is the demand side that receives increasing attention by research and industry.

It ranges from improving energy efficiency by using better materials, over smart energy tariffs with incentives for certain consumption patterns, up to sophisticated real-time control of distributed energy resources. This paper gives an overview and a taxonomy for DSM, analyzes the various types of DSM, and gives an outlook on the latest demonstration projects in this domain.},

  Abstract                 = {All power generation technologies leave their particular imprint on the power system that they belong to. Wind and solar power have only recently reached significant levels of penetration in some countries, but they are expected to grow much during the next few decades, and contribute substantially to meeting future electricity demand, see e.g. European Commission (2011). Wind, photovoltaic (PV) solar and concentrated solar power (CSP) with no storage have non-controllable variability, partial unpredictability and locational dependency. These attributes make an analysis of their impacts on electricity generation system operation and design particularly interesting. This paper reviews how a strong presence of intermittent renewable generation will change how future power systems are planned, operated and controlled. The change is already noticeable in countries that currently have a large penetration of wind and solar production. The mix of generation technologies, and potentially market rules, will have to adapt to accommodate this presence. Regulatory adjustments might be needed to attract investment in "well adapted" technologies. This paper identifies open issues that deserve further analysis from a technical, economic and regulatory perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {There is inconsistency in many people's choice of electricity. When asked, they say they prefer a ‘green’ (i.e., environmentally friendly) source for this energy. Yet, although green electricity is available in many markets, people do not generally buy it. Why not? Motivated by behavioural decision research, we argue that the format of information presentation drastically affects the choice of electricity. Specifically, we hypothesise that people use the kind of electricity that is offered to them as the default. We present two natural studies and two experiments in the laboratory that support this hypothesis. In the two real-world situations, there was a green default, and most people used it. In the first laboratory experiment, more participants chose the green utility when it was the default than when ‘grey’ electricity was the default. In the second laboratory experiment, participants asked for more money to give up green electricity than they were willing to pay for it. We argue that changing defaults can be used to promote pro-environmental behaviour. Potential policy-making applications of this work are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Data-driven generic simulators have, for many years, been used to model a wide range of systems. Some such simulators are promoted as general purpose, while others are specific to particular problem domains. This paper considers how domain-specific data-driven simulators should be constructed using a modular approach which allows the simulator to be incrementally enhanced and ported easily to alternative computing environments. It also argues that generic simulators will not wholly replace simulation programming for specific applications.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper proposes a new approach to simula tion modeling of natural systems in the context of water quality modeling in streams affected by point source pollution. The approach has a potential for application to other domains of natural resource modeling. Its conceptual basis is knowledge-based simulation and systems analysis. In the approach presented in this paper, a stream or its section is viewed as a collection of components, i.e. stream segments. The structure of a stream is its segments and their couplings. For each stream segment, a single constituent model describing processes affecting the segment's water quality is defined. Models are coupled in a hierarchical manner. The hierarchi cal, modular model specification results in a stream model comprised of a finite number of sub-segment models. Fundamental theoretical concepts supporting such a specification are described. A prototype simulation modeling environment to support prediction of water quality in streams has been implemented and tested. The proposed approach differs from other natural systems modeling frameworks in that it offers a) modular model specification facilities, b) high degree of model reusability, and c) support for model selection and coupling. },

  Abstract                 = { Environmental problems have their origins in human behavior, and as a result, any solution to environmental issues will require changes in behavior. While many disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences offer important perspectives on the behaviors linked with environmental problems, the study of the individual brings a focus on cognitive, social, and motivational processes that provides insights into effective ways to promote change. Psychological research on proenvironmental behavior dates back nearly 40 years, and within this rich body of empirical research are a number of well-established findings. Strategies such as prompts, commitments, feedback, social norms, incentives, and convenience have all been shown to effectively promote proenvironmental behavior â?? at least in some contexts, for some behaviors, and for some individuals. This article begins with a brief overview of these research findings, and then proceeds to examine the less-explored question about when various strategies work. The article concludes with recommendations for selecting an appropriate strategy for promoting behavior change, along with fruitful areas for future research. },

To test a theoretical account of this inconsistency, we conducted a field experiment in which normative messages were used to promote household energy conservation. As predicted, a descriptive normative message detailing average neighborhood usage produced either desirable energy savings or the undesirable boomerang effect, depending on whether households were already consuming at a low or high rate. Also as predicted, adding an injunctive message (conveying social approval or disapproval) eliminated the boomerang effect. The results offer an explanation for the mixed success of persuasive appeals based on social norms and suggest how such appeals should be properly crafted.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for data-based selection of the bandwidth in kernel density estimation which has excellent properties. It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy has an ambivalent status in social theory, variously figuring as a driver or an outcome of social and institutional change, or as something that is woven into the fabric of society itself. In this article the authors consider the underlying models on which different approaches depend. One common strategy is to view energy as a resource base, the management and organization of which depends on various intersecting systems: political, economic and technological. This is not the only route to take. The authors develop an alternative approach, viewing energy supply and energy demand as part of the ongoing reproduction of bundles and complexes of social practice. In articulating and comparing these two positions they show how social-theoretical commitments influence the ways in which problems like those of reducing carbon emissions are framed and addressed. Whereas theories of practice highlight basic questions about what energy is for, these issues are routinely and perhaps necessarily obscured by those who see energy as an abstract resource that structures or that is structured by a range of interlocking social systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Demand managers currently draw on a limited range of psychology and economic theories in order to shift and shed peak electricity demand. These theories place individual consumers and their attitudes, behaviours and choices at the centre of the problem. This paper reframes the issue of peak electricity demand using theories of social practices, contending that the ‘problem’ is one of transforming, technologically-mediated social practices. It reflects on how this body of theory repositions and refocuses the roles and practices of professions charged with the responsibility and agency for affecting and managing energy demand. The paper identifies three areas where demand managers could refocus their attention: (i) enabling co-management relationships with consumers; (ii) working beyond their siloed roles with a broader range of human and non-human actors; and (iii) promoting new practice ‘needs’ and expectations. It concludes by critically reflecting on the limited agency attributed to ‘change agents’ such as demand managers in dominant understandings of change. Instead, the paper proposes the need to identify and establish a new group of change agents who are actively but often unwittingly involved in reconfiguring the elements of problematic peaky practices.},

These programs and policies provide social, economic, and environmental benefits. Social and behavioral scientists can inform policymaking and evaluation because of their expertise in behavioral change. Specifically, policies will be more effective if they include a behavioral level analysis to help select behaviors, design behavioral change strategies that target appropriate motives and abilities, and attend to social and environmental contexts. After describing these principles, the article illustrates how they can inform the evaluation of labeling programs designed to encourage energy-efficient behaviors among consumers, manufacturers, and building owners.},

  Abstract                 = {Many experts are concerned about the would-be character of smart grid users—specifically, that they will not engage with smart grid technologies out of disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This has been considered problematic because users are considered key to unlocking the full potential of the smart grid. This paper studied smart grid users from the Norwegian demo Steinkjer pilot and, through focus group interviews, collected articulations of everyday smart grid enactments. Eliciting little lack in knowledge or interest, users were able to articulate relevant smart grid enactments through a spectrum of skepticism, pragmatism and enthusiasm. Utilizing the concept of material publics [22], this paper argued that smart meters can bridge the green political economy of climate challenge issues with the user context of everyday energy consumption. The paper found evidence that user articulations, whether skeptical or enthusiastic, are rooted in political engagement as opposed to purely economic interest. This suggests a case for involving material publics in the smart grid and indicates that explanations for user disengagement can be found in active, subversive co-articulations among users rather than passive disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This paper suggests acknowledging smart grid users as politically engaged material publics.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most common demand side management programs consists of time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, where consumers are charged differently depending on the time of the day when they make use of energy services. This paper assesses the impacts of TOU tariffs on a dataset of residential users from the Province of Trento in Northern Italy in terms of changes in electricity demand, price savings, peak load shifting and peak electricity demand at sub-station level. Findings highlight that TOU tariffs bring about higher average electricity consumption and lower payments by consumers. A significant level of load shifting takes place for morning peaks. However, issues with evening peaks are not resolved. Finally, TOU tariffs lead to increases in electricity demand for substations at peak time.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A recent surge of research has investigated the potential of pro-environmental behavior interventions to affect other pro-environmental behaviors not initially targeted by the intervention. The evidence evaluating these spillover effects has been mixed, with some studies finding evidence for positive spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior increases the likelihood of performing additional pro-environmental behaviors) and others finding negative spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior decreases the likelihood of additional pro-environmental behaviors). Different academic disciplines have investigated this question, employing different methodologies and arriving at divergent findings. This paper provides a unifying theoretical framework and uses the framework to review the existing research on pro-environmental behavior spillover. Our framework identifies different decision modes as competing mechanisms that drive adoption of initial pro-environmental behaviors, with different consequences for subsequent pro-environmental behaviors, leading to positive, negative, or no spillover. Attribution of the initial pro-environmental behavior to either an external motivator (e.g., a price signal) or internal motivator (e.g., self-identity) also matters. In addition, the characteristics of and similarity between initial and subsequent pro-environmental behaviors can be expected to moderate predicted spillover effects. We explore the implications of our model for policymakers and practitioners, and suggest key areas where future research on the topic would be most beneficial. },

  Abstract                 = {The future of air transportation modeling and simulation represents a grand challenge for both the air transportation and the modeling and simulation communities. In addition to its size and scope, air transportation has many technical, operational, organizational, policy, security and legal aspects contributing to its complexity, yet must ensure an un-rivaled level of safety throughout any transition to next generation systems. Thus, modeling and simulation must address not only technical challenges in representing a system of this complexity, but also institutional realities that prevent full data and model sharing between the many entities involved in air transportation. We outline the attributes of a shared repository of data, models and computational tools required to meet this challenge, including the coordination and administrative processes required to manage it, and provide an example of its potential application.},
